The strategic marketing plan provides a comprehensive document outlining the goals,
objectives, strategies, and tactics for the companyâ€™s marketing activities. It serves as a roadmap
for the marketing team, guiding their actions to achieve specific business outcomes. For
example, expanding into new markets and increasing market share may be a strategic objective.
Strategies to accomplish this could include market research, adapting products/services,
localized marketing approaches, collaboration with local partners, targeted advertising, and
monitoring performance.
